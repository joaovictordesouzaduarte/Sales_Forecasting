<h1> 1) Business problem </h1>
The stores of the Rossmann drugstore chain need to be restored and the CEO needs to decide how much is going to be dedicated to the restoration of each one. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required forecast models for the Analytics team to support his decision that how much budget in each store needs to be allocated.


<h1> 2) Business results </h1>
The gross expected income of a majority of Rossman's stores found was: at the Best Scenario:  R$287,845,044.97; Worst Scenario: R$286,117,462.33 and our Predicted Scenario:  R$286,981,248.00, as you can see in the imagem below. These scenarios are predicted using the mean absolute percentage error.  The same statistical error is applied to each store, individually.

<h1> 3) Business Hypothesis </h1>
  Through this project, a vary of hypothesis was come up by me. All of these hypotheses are listed in step 02 called "Feature Engineering". New features were created to make     possible a more thorough analysis.

<h1> 3) Machine Learning Performance </h1>
The performance of every trained model, after cross-validation. The columns correspond to the metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Root Mean Squared Error.

<h1> 4) Conclusion </h1>

  As we can see, these models have a wide RMSE indicating that this phenomenon studied cannot be modeled by using linear machine learning models. However, the sales forecast and the generated insights provide the CEO with valuable tools to decide the amount of budget that is going to be dedicated to the restoration of each store.
